# RPG IT

This project is about my first 'bigger' project I started doing while a two month project phase during my studies.
It's an gamified RPG to-do list, to keep motivated while getting all your daily, weekly and montly tasks done.

## Task System
It's simple: do your tasks, get XP, level up your character and get new loot.
